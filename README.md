Hi there 👋🏻,

🔭 I am currently focused on developing cutting-edge multi-modality models capable of generating and understanding text and images natively.

My specific areas of interest include:
- Path planning

---
- ~~Document Understanding & Layout Analysis~~
- ~~Optical Character Recognition~~
- ~~Object Detection~~

PS: I recognize all these tasks as path-planning tasks. (2023/12)

In addition to my current work, I have prior experience in Robotics Perception from my Master's studies. I hope my work can be helpful to you.


Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's anything I can assist with!
